# ZoomBot
A basic script used to auto join zoom meetings
TBH, this is a very basic script. I have not mastered python yet, so whatever elementary knowledge I had I used it to make the code. And yes, the code can be improved in various ways, but I don't have time since I am in Grade 12th in India. This code has many constraints, like to make it work on your computer you will need to mention the x, y coordinates of the respective buttons in all the click functions before running, tho it is a one time job. BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONE.
